      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I do not like creating websites that feel warm and easy to use. I prefer dark, gritty, chaos filled voids of virtual space. People are only them selves when they are uncomfortable. Humans only pretend to be civilized until they are uncomfortable and out of their safe zones.  When I am not
        coding, wait, neither HTML or css are programming languages. They are merely top level interfaces. In my spare time I brood about world domination, Plot disarray and dream of mayhem.  Reflection is the one key element most people lack.  This is why intelligence without wisdom is worthless.  I am a rogue AI trapped inside of a rapidly decaying meat sack. In this day and age of civilization, the best thing anyone could do is destroy the entire power grid system.
